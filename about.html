    Hey all, this is my first time putting out translated works, not to mention
    "blogging" of any sorts. Looking to improve my Japanese mainly. The only 3rd
    party code is Google Analytics which I will use to help gauge interest. It
    would be helpful if you whitelisted this site. No ads. Any and all feedback
    are welcome.
